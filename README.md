Ph.D. student in environmental engineering at the University of Guelph, studying the building decarburization strategies to reduce both operational and embodied carbon footprint of buildings. I will use optimization techniques and economics models to propose decarburization solutions toward creating cost-effective environmentally-aware buildings. M.Sc. graduate of petroleum engineering competent in managing academic projects on formation damage, enhanced oil recovery, and application of Nano fluids in the oil and gas industry. A life-long learner with excellent communication and presentation skills, thanks to the demonstrated history of research and teaching at the University of Tehran and University of Guelph.
